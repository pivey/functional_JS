#Functional JS sketchpad

I am trying to better my understanding of functional programming in JavaScript, here I have created a 'sketchpad' so that I can work with and test out some functions and methods to make my code more efficient and elegant. I hope to keep adding to this repo as I find new and interesting functional programming techniques.
